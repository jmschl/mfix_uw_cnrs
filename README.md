# mfix_uw_cnrs
Shared folder between Alain, Alex, George, Jill, and Zack to keep
files for our work on mfix.

The initial directory is broken up into mfix versions 2015.1 and
2016.1.

The directories are labeled with a combination of the following codes:
	ht: heat transfer
	lb: lubrication
	fc: force chains
	nm: normal mfix

If these codes are included in the directory name, they include
these updates to the original mfix code. Within these
directories should have the corresponding subdirectories (e.g.
des/ check_data/ etc.)
